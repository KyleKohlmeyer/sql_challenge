# SQL challenge
This is my SQL challenge submission. All code in this repository is my own.
## Entity Relationship Diagram
An Entity relationship diagram was created for the data provided using the quick database diagrams app: https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
The resulting diagram can be seen visually in the SQL ERD Image, and the code to create the schema can be found in the Schema.SQL file.
## Data analysis
The ERD diagram was imported into Postgres SQL directly from the app. The formatting for the table creation was edited, and the data from the CSV files was imported. 
The data used can be found in the data folder here in this repository.
The tables necessary for analysis were then created. The code can be found in the Analysis.SQL file.
