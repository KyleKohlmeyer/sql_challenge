# SQL challenge
This is my SQL challenge submission. All code in this repository is my own.
## Entity Relationship Diagram
An Entity relationship diagram was created for the data provided using the quick database diagrams app: https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
The resulting diagram can be seen visually in the SQL ERD Image. 
## Table creation
The schema was then imported from quickdatabasediagrams and slightly tweaked to create the tables found in the Schema.SQL file.
The quotations on table and column names were removed, and the primary and foreign keys were declared in a more readable and efficient way. 
The data from the CSV files was then imported into these tables.
## Data analysis
The tables necessary for analysis were then created in PostgreSQL from the original tables above. 
The code can be found in the Analysis.SQL file.
The data used can be found in the data folder.
